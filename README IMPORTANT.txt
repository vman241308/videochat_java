New main classes are ClientStart.java, VideoServerStart.java, and AudioServerStart.java
In case these don't work, uncomment the main methods in Client.java, AudioServer.java and VideoServer.java and run those
ClientStart.java, VideoServerStart.java, and AudioServerStart.java are just for user input
If we skip those it's ok.
Besides that gui is implemented.
